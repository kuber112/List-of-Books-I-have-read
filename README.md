# List-of-Books-I-have-read
Just want to share the books I have read. Keeps me accountable. A lot of the books I read are technical and math heavy. So be warned!

## Technical Books
| Item         | Description     | Review |
|--------------|-----------|------------|
| Modern Robotics by Kevin Lynch | Learned a lot of mechanics here.  | I went through almost of the book.     | 
|Introduction to Cybernetics by W. R. Ashby | |Recommend it. Became a fan of him. |
| The Problem of Increasing Human Energy by Nikola Tesla | | A physicist's approach to climbing up the Kardashev scale; though he did not mention the Kardashev scale because he hasn't encountered the Kardashev scale (as far as I know) |

I have more that I have read. Gonna add them here soon.
