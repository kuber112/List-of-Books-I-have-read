# List-of-Books-I-have-read
Just want to share the books I have read. Keeps me accountable. A lot of the books I read are technical and math heavy. So be warned!

## Technical Books
| Item         | Description     | Review |
|--------------|-----------|------------|
| Modern Robotics by Kevin Lynch | Learned a lot of mechanics here.  | I went through almost of the book.     | 
|Introduction to Cybernetics by W. R. Ashby | |Recommend it. Became a fan of him. |
| The Problem of Increasing Human Energy by Nikola Tesla | | A physicist's approach to climbing up the Kardashev scale; though he did not mention the Kardashev scale because he hasn't encountered the Kardashev scale (as far as I know) |
| Introduction to Linear Algebra by Gilbert Strang | | Another math book. Skipped some parts since some of it is already included in other books.|

I have more that I have read. Gonna add them here soon.

## Authors whose books I am interested in

| Person | Description | Review |
|--------------|-----------|------------|
| William Ross Ashby |   |
| Shannon Eldwood Claude |   |
| Norbert Wiener| |
|Gilbert Strang | He is good at linear algebra |
| John von Neumann | | 
| Yann Lecun | |

I probably should add more newer authors who is still contributing post 2000's. I do not want to dilute the focus of the topics I am interested though. Theres only a handful of great works out there that are worth reading. A problem for tomorrow to think about.


## Concerns
_**As much as I would like to be transparent with whoever is reading my page, there is also the nagging concern that I should not reveal all I know and what I have studied. Again, it is something very hard for me to take into consideration.**_
